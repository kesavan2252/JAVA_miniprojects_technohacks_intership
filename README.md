# Simple Java Calculator

Welcome to our first Java calculator project! The goal is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with proper exception handling for division by zero.

## Description

This project involves creating a simple calculator application in Java. The calculator will support the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with exception handling for division by zero)

## Step 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

### Add
### Subtract
### Multiply
### Divide

We've set up 4 operations that you need to implement. These operations should be straightforward if you recall your lessons on basic operators in Java!

### Exception Handling

- In the `divide` method, ensure that you handle the case where the denominator is zero. If `b` is zero, the method should return an appropriate error message like `"Error: Division by zero is not allowed."`.
